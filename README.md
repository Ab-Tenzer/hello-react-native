# hello-react-native
How I got to build my first react native app

Task: Create two cross-platform apps for Multichoice, namely DStv and GOtv

Timelines
  Start: 8 August
  End: 31 September
  
Background Context: Previously a C# developer, who's never created any apps before :)
  
Let the journey begin....

The idea is to document pretty much every part of this discovery, from dev environment set up and beyond...
